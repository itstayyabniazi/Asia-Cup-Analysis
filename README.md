**File included in this Dataset are:**
- asiacup.csv
- batsman data odi.csv
- batsman data t20i.csv
- bowler data odi.csv
- bowler data t20i.csv
- champion.csv

## Prediction for Next Season
To predict the next winner of the upcoming Asia Cup season based on the past performance of teams, we can apply a simple regression model to estimate the team's performance (e.g., based on total runs scored, wickets taken, and other factors). Here we used scikit-learn as it provides tools for data mining, analysis, and building machine learning models.
